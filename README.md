# Brain Tumor Segmentations

The Brain Tumor Segmentation Sample demonstrates the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit performance optimization in a healthcare use case. The U-Net architecture is used to model and predict the location of brain tumors in MRI scans.

#### This demo has two parts:

1. [Inference with MKL-DNN](Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_MKL-DNN):

  * using stock TensorFlow*
  * using Intel-optimized TensorFlow and MKL-DNN


2. [Inference with OpenVINO](Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_OpenVINO):

    This example features the brain tumor segmentation using the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit for model optimization and inference. In this implementation, the code can be executed not only on Intel® CPUs, but also on accelerators, such as Intel® HD Graphics, Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2, Intel® Movidius™ Vision Processing Unit (VPU), and an Intel® FPGA (HDDL-F).
